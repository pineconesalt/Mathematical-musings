# Introduction
My disseration for Open university on the subject of Calculus of Variations was influenced by Courant & Hilbert's Methods of Mathematical Physics Vol II, Chapter VI and the Mark Kac's paper "Can One Hear the Shape of a Drum?" 

# Abstract
This dissertation investigates the eigenvalues for different domains of the problem
∆u + λu = 0. It begins with a brief historical overview and methods for calculating
simple models such as a string, rectangular and circular domains, before reaching the
main topic of modelling domains using the methods of calculus of variations, along
with the Rayleigh quotient, the Rayleigh-Ritz method and the maximum-minimum
principles.
These methods and proofs where applied to model the asymptotic behaviour for
arbitrary two-dimensional domains for which calculations of eigenvalues too complex
are investigated, giving a firm foundation to discuss the paper ”Can One Hear
the Shape of a Drum” by Mark Kac. A brief look at work conducted after this
famous question in which was answered by Gordon, Webb and Wolpert where it
was found that generally you cannot but for more specific domains such as triangles
and isothermal drums the answer Kac’s question is answered in the affirmative.
